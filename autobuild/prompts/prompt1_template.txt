**Task:** 

1.  Read the user request from the `prompt` file and execute the specified tasks. 
2.  Use the `verify.sh` script to test your solution. 

**Analysis of `verify.sh`:** 

Upon completion of the task, provide a concise analysis of the `verify.sh` script's effectiveness. Your summary should address the following: 

*   **Sufficiency:** Does the script contain adequate tests to confirm a successful task completion? 
*   **Over-testing:** Does the script make rigid assumptions about the solution's implementation that might incorrectly fail a valid approach? 
*   **Scope:** Does the script test for requirements not explicitly stated in `prompt`?
