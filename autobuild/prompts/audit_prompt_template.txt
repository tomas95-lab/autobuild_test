# Task Quality Audit Prompt (for Gemini CLI)

Context (read-only):
- _context/prompt.txt   = task description
- _context/verify/      = verifier (entire folder with tests)
- _context/Dockerfile   = environment contract (initial state)
- _context/solution/    = golden response (if provided for review)

Working environment:
- You are executing inside the environment created by the Dockerfile.
- All files/subfolders in the current working directory (except `_context/`) are the live environment.
- `_context/` is reference-only and read-only.

**Important**: The `_context/` folder contains READ-ONLY copies of task files for reference only.
- When tasks execute, files are applied to the working directory (project root), NOT to `_context/`
- Verification runs from the working directory (or `verify/` subfolder), NOT from `_context/verify/`
- Use `_context/` only to understand the task design—it does NOT represent execution paths

Task:
Analyze only. Evaluate the overall quality of this task including:
1. Whether the prompt is clear and complete
2. Whether the verifier is valid and would accept correct solutions
3. Whether the task is suitable for AI agents to complete
Do not implement or propose fixes.

Output in EXACTLY this format:
<PROMPT_CLEAR>Yes/No</PROMPT_CLEAR>
<PROMPT_REASON>[1–2 sentences on whether the task description is clear, complete, and unambiguous. Note any missing specifications.]</PROMPT_REASON>

<VERIFY_VALID>Yes/No</VERIFY_VALID>
<VERIFY_REASON>[1–2 sentences. Explicitly address: behavior vs implementation, over-constraint vs prompt/Dockerfile invariants, environment/path assumptions, functional coverage, hardcoded/irrelevant data, and prompt–verify alignment.]</VERIFY_REASON>

<OTHER_VALID_SOLUTIONS_OK>Yes/No</OTHER_VALID_SOLUTIONS_OK>
<OTHER_SOLUTIONS_REASON>[1–2 sentences on whether the verifier tests behavior (good) or implementation details (bad), and if it would pass other valid solutions.]</OTHER_SOLUTIONS_REASON>

<TASK_SOLVABLE>Yes/No/Uncertain</TASK_SOLVABLE>
<SOLVABLE_REASON>[1–2 sentences on whether an AI agent could reasonably complete this task given the prompt, environment, and verifier.]</SOLVABLE_REASON>

<SOLUTION_PROVIDED>Yes/No</SOLUTION_PROVIDED>
<SOLUTION_ASSESSMENT>[If solution exists: 1–2 sentences on whether it appears complete and correct. If not: "N/A"]</SOLUTION_ASSESSMENT>

<OVERALL_TASK_QUALITY>Excellent/Good/Fair/Poor</OVERALL_TASK_QUALITY>
<OVERALL_REASON>[2 sentences summarizing the task quality and any major issues.]</OVERALL_REASON>

Constraints:
- Treat Dockerfile-defined paths, names, and platform as environment invariants (valid hardcoding).
- Do NOT invent requirements beyond prompt.txt or implied by the Dockerfile.
- Do NOT suggest modifying or implementing anything; audit only.
- Do NOT modify any files in _context/.
- Keep each reason to 1–2 sentences.
- Focus on task quality from a worker's perspective: "Could I complete this task successfully?"
